# Sprofil: an iOS app

> the platform for sharing and discovering music with your friends

Sprofil is an iOS application for Spotify users to share their music tastes and explore other users' music tastes. Spotify is the world's leading music streaming platform. Users create a profile, which auto-generates insights and statistics, and they customize their profile with their name, biography, and selected widgets. Users can find other users' profiles through search or through a curated explore page. They also have the ability to friend and unfriend users to have easy access to their friends' profiles as well as view them even if their friends have enabled privacy settings.

Requirements: iOS 15+, an existing Spotify account
